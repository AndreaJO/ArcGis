# Adding new data

We can either drag the data into our ArcMap window or to avoid problems, use the <b>add data</b> button.
The data will be now displayed in the <b>Table of contents</b>, where there are 4 different types of listing the data:

* List by drawing order

* List by source: The container folder of the data will be displayed

* List by visibility: the layers will be classified depending if they are active or not

* List by selection: the layers will be classified depending if they are editable or not
