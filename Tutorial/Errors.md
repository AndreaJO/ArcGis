# Error selecting features

A layer can be damaged and therefore, ArcGIS will not allow us to select any part of the feature neither with the <b>editor arrow</b> nor with the <b>select feature</b> command.

To fix it we will have to run a <b>Repair Geometry</b>

#Error 001143

Happened during <b> Raster Calculator </b>
Solution: disable background processes in ArcGIS via the Geoprocessing Options dialog box.
